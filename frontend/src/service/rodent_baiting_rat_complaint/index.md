The [Department of Streets & Sanitation](http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/streets.html) investigates reported rat sightings. Alley conditions are examined, including garbage carts. If any damaged carts are identified, the Sanitation Ward Office is notified. Rodenticide is placed in deep into rat burrows to eradicate nests. You can [request a new garbage cart here](https://servicerequest.cityofchicago.org/web_intake_chic/Controller?op=locform&invSRType=SIE&invSRDesc=Garbage%20Cart%20Black%20Maintenance/Replacement&locreq=Y&stnumreqd=Y). Remember: If rats can't feed, rats can't breed. 

The Bureau of Rodent Control is also responsible for the [removal of bees wasp, and hornet nests](http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/streets/provdrs/rodent/svcs/bees_wasps_hornets.html).

Another method for combatting rats is [rat stoppage tickets](http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/streets/provdrs/rodent/svcs/rat_stoppage_tickets.html) that are issued to property owners who allow exterior building conditions that provide harborage for rats.

Here's a helpful brochure form the past on [how you can rat-proof your property](http://www.slideshare.net/juggernautco/bureau-ofrodentcontrolbrochure).
