Chicago Works For You
=====================

http://www.chicagoworksforyou.com

CWFY runs on Jekyll and Compass.

The templates and source posts and pages are in the `src` directory; the
Jekyll-generated site is written out to the `site` directory.

Getting started
---------------

Install Jekyll and dependencies:

 * `gem install jekyll --no-rdoc --no-ri`
 * `gem install compass --no-rdoc --no-ri`

To rebuild the site:

 * Type `make` and hit return.

To run a local server and have it rebuild the site automatically during
development:

 * Type `make server` and hit return. By default, the dev server is available
   at [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/).
